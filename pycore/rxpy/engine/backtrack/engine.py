'''
A matcher implementation using a simple interpreter-based approach with the
`Visitor` interface.  State is encapsulated in `State` while program flow 
uses trampolining to avoid exhausting the Python stack.  In addition, to
further reduce the use of the (non-Python) stack, simple repetition is
"run length" compressed (this addresses ".*" matching against long strings, 
for example).

    A stack of states.  This extends a simple stack with the ability to 
    compress repeated states (which is useful to avoid filling the stack
    with backtracking when something like ".*" is used to match a large 
    string).
    
    The compression is quite simple: if a state and group are pushed to
    the stack which are identical, apart from offset, with the existing top
    of the stack, then the stack is not extended.  Instead, the new offset
    and increment are appended to the existing entry.  The same occurs for
    further pushes that have the same increment.
    
    On popping we create a new state, and adjust the offset as necessary.
    
    For this to work correctly we must also be careful to preserve the
    original state, since that is the one that contains the most text.
    Later states have less text and so cannot be cloned "back" to having
    an earlier offset.
